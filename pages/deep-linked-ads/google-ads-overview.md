## Enabling and Segmenting View-Through Conversions in reporting

By default, Google Ads includes View-Through Conversion counts in a separate column in reporting. If you have impression windows enabled in Branch, we can also attribute VTC installs and events (when there is not a matching click from another partner). Those will be grouped into the install and event counts, and can be segmented using the 'last attributed touch type' compare by in Branch reporting. You can manage settings to enable this attribution within the attribution settings tab of the Google AdWords partner management or by reaching out to support@branch.io


## Forwarding Events to Google Ads

Once you begin tracking events through the Branch SDK, you can select which events to import in Google Ads. Google Ads has pre-defined events that map to pre-defined Branch events, listed below. Reference this [doc](https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking/api/) for more information.

Regardless of campaign type, Branch will forward in-app events to Google Ads for campaign optimization. In addition, Branch will receive attribution data for rich analysis in the Branch dashboard.

Google Event | Branch Event

first_open | install
session_start | open
in_app_purchase | purchase
view_item_list | view_items
view_item | view_item
