Whereas Universal App Campaigns are focused solely on the single conversion type of `app download`, you can leverage other Google Ads campaign types - **Search, Display, Shopping, Video** - to expand your marketing efforts that enable both app and web conversions.

## Requirements

### Basic Integration Prerequisites
* [x] Branch SDK integrated into your app.
* [x] Collect the IDFA on iOS, or the AAID on Android. For specifics, refer to the set up guide for [iOS](/apps/ios/#install-branch) and [Android](/apps/android/#install-branch) respectively.
* [x] Track all necessary events through the SDKs, with instructions [here](#forwarding-events-to-google-ads).
* [x] Have admin access to your Google Ads account; required for generating Link IDs in Google Ads.

### Web Routing Only Prerequisites

If you are running any Web-based (non-UAC) Google Ads campaigns and want to leverage the power of Branch for **desktop and mobile web** conversions, please make sure you complete the following:

* [x] [Basic Integration Prerequisites](#basic-integration-prerequisites)
* [x] [Branch Web SDK v2.48.0+](/web/integrate/)
* [x] [Measurement of relevant v2 events](/web/integrate/#track-events)

### Web + App Routing Prerequisites

If you are running any Web-based (non-UAC) Google Ads campaigns and want to leverage the full power of Branch's routing capabilities for **desktop/mobile web conversions AND deep linking into apps via Branch links**, please make sure you also complete the following:

* [x] [Basic Integration Prerequisites](#basic-integration-prerequisites)
* [x] [Web Routing Prerequisites](#web-routing-only-prerequisites)
* [x] Place your [modified Branch link](#modifying-your-final-url-to-include-your-branch-link-as-a-query-parameter) in the `Final URL` field during Google Ads campaign setup.
* [x] Branch Deep Linking enabled via either:
	* [x] Adding `$uri_redirect_mode=1` to link's data.  If app link settings `URI Deep Link Mode` is set to `Intelligent`, then this link key is unnecessary.

## Setup

!!! warning "**Enabling Required**"
		Before you can leverage our integration with Google Ads, you must **[Enable the Google Ads integration](/deep-linked-ads/google-ads-enable/)** in your Branch dashboard.

### Create a Branch Ad Link

1. Create a Branch Ad link from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management)'s `Create Google Ads Link` button under the Google Ads Partner and select `Create Search/Display Link` depending on the type of Google Ads campaign you are running.
<img src="/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/reusable-images/create-link-display.png" alt="Link Creation" class="three-quarters center">
1. Under the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference
1. Configure the link with the Ad Format set to **Search** or **Display** and the Ad Partner set to **Google Ads**.
![Create Ad Link](/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/google-xplatform-display-ads/link-setup.png)
1. Under the Configure Options tab, navigate to the Redirects sub section and ensure that the Web redirect is set to the desired final website promoted by the ad campaign.
![Create Ad Link](/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/reusable-images/example-link-redirect.png)
1. Under the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to fill in these fields as they can be used as filters in Branch's Ads Analytics view. To best connect your ad link with your Adwords Campaign:
 	1. Set the `Channel` field to Google Ads
	1. Set the `Campaign` field to the same ad campaign name used in Google Ads
	1. Add a new tag - `~campaign_id` - to the same campaign ID in Google Ads
![Analytics Tags](/_assets/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/reusable-images/adwords-analytics-tags.png)

!!! warning "Analytics Tags"
	In order to line up *impressions*, *clicks* and *cost* with all downstream events, analytics tags must be present on the link and the values must *exactly* match the values in the Ad Network's dashboard.

!!! note "Optional: Deep Link Data"
	You can use this configuration section to specify custom link parameters that will be deep linked into the app after install. These could include a coupon code or a page identifier to route the user. Visit the [Deep Link Routing](/deep-linking/routing/) page to learn more.

#### Modifying your Final URL to Include Your Branch Link as a Query Parameter

!!! note "For Branch Deep Linking into App Only"
	Because the **Final URL** for your campaigns must match your display URL and not contain any cross-domain redirects, you cannot put a Branch link directly in that box. However, you can append query parameters to the Final URL in order to pass the required data needed for Branch to route and attribute your users properly.

1. Copy your Branch Ad Link from the last section and ensure the copied link has the appropriate additional params (~campaign_id, ~ad_set_id, lpurl, etc.) which should be automatically generated on your Branch dashboard.
1. URL encode the Branch Ad Link you just created and copied, however leave any "{" or "}" unencoded. This will ensure these valuetrack params are properly filled in by Google.
1. Append &branchify_url=PARTIALLY URL ENDCODED BRANCH LINK to your Final URL.

### Create Your Campaign

!!! warning "Campaign Types Supported"
	Please refer to the [Appendix](/deep-linked-ads/google-ads-non-uac/#appendix) for all of the web-based campaign types supported.

!!! tip "Branch Link Placement in Google Ads Campaign"
	During campaign creation, please make sure you place the Branch link in the correct location depending on your desired user outcome.

	- **For Web Routing Only** - place your Branch link in the `Tracking Template` field during Google Ads campaign setup.
	- **For Deep Linking into App if App Installed else Routing to Web** - place your modified Branch Link in the `Final URL` field during Google Ads campaign setup.

!!! tip "Setting Attribution Windows"
	You can specify the attribution windows for your links either at an overall account or per link level. Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to [Changing attribution windows](/deep-linked-ads/branch-universal-ads/#change-attribution-windows) for instructions.

For Search App Extensions, the Google Conversion API that Branch relies on for app event attribution will confirm Android conversions, with limited support for iOS search/web attributions. You can use a Branch link within the tracking template for iOS App Extensions, but this will result in attributions counted in Branch that are not counted as conversions in Google.
