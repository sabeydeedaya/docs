## How do trials work?

What’s great about Branch is all products come with a 14-Day Trial. We want our customers to be successful while using Branch products and this trial period allows setup and testing of the product(s) free of charge. For example, if you sign up on the 1st of the month, paid usage will not begin accruing until your trial period is over, 14 days later.


## How does billing works?

Branch’s service period runs from the 1st of the month to the last day of the month. Your Branch billing cycle is recurrent and occurs on a monthly basis on the 1st of every month. If you sign up part way through the month, your first invoice will be prorated. 
 

## What happens if I sign up part way through the month?

All partial billing periods will be prorated. If you sign up for any of our premium products part way through the month, your first invoice will be prorated. For example, if you sign up on May 25th, your trial will start on May 25th and will run for 14 days, until June 7th. Your charges and usage will accrue from June 8th to June 30th, and your first invoice will be issued on July.


## When will I be billed?

For online subscriptions (i.e. Customer signs up to Branch’s premium products directly from the website), Branch bills in arrears which means we will send your invoice at the end of the service period, rather than up front (in advance). 
 

## How do overages work?

Your online subscription may be charged overages if your usage exceeds the MAU limit included, based on your plan selection. An overage fee of $5 will apply for each additional 1k MAUs above the limit, based on your plan selection. For example, you sign up for a plan that charges $0/monthly fee for up to 10K MAUs but your usage for a given month is 12K MAUs. The 2K MAU will be considered usage above the 10K MAU limit; therefore, your invoice will include an overage fee of $10.


## What payment methods do you accept?

For online subscriptions, we only accept credit cards. Please ensure your credit card meets the following criteria, for a successful payment set up:

1. Credit card must be a revolving account with a line of credit
2. The billing address entered matches the billing address in your credit card statement
3. For international customers, make sure the credit card accepts foreign transactions.

Once your payment and billing information has been entered, no further action is required to pay off your monthly invoice.
 

## What happens if my credit card is not accepted (Error 322)?

If the system provides an Error 322 when entering your credit card, follow these basic troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify the billing address matches the billing address on your credit card statement
2. Verify that there aren’t too many sales/authorizations on your card in a short period of time
3. For international customers, verify your credit card has permission to accept US charges
4. Verify your credit card is not a prepaid card

If you continue to experience issues, please contact your financial institution for further assistance. If there’s any action and/or transaction Branch can help with, feel free to contact our support team at billing@branch.io.

We will send an email to the billing contact in the account with the details of the charge and a copy of the invoice receipt. If you have questions about your bill and/or need help requesting a copy of your invoice, please reach out to billing@branch.io.
