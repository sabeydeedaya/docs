## Understand deep linking

- ### Default link behavior

    - #### Your app is not installed

        - User `clicks` on a Branch deep link

        - Device `navigates` to the [fallback](#custom-link-behavior) (e.g. an app store or website)

        - User `installs` and `opens` your app

        - Branch passes deep link `data` into your app

    - #### Your app is installed

        -  User `clicks` on a Branch deep link

        -  Device `opens` your app or navigates to [expected link behavior](#expected-link-behavior)

        -  Branch passes deep link `data` into your app

    - #### Expected link behavior

        - Expected link behavior is dependent on whether or not the app supports deep linking

- ### Custom link behavior

    - #### Pass data from link to app

        - Add [link data](#configure-deep-links) to each deep link

        - Add key-values pairs to your [Quick Links](/dashboard/analytics/#quick-links)

        - Append query strings `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD?$custom_data=123&hello=world`

    - #### Fallback to a specific URL

        - Determine where a deep link will navigate to if either

            - Your app is not installed

            - *[or]* Another app prevent links from deep linking outside their app

        - Fallback overrides *(ordered by precedence)*
            - Add query string `https://example.app.link?$ios_url=https://example.com`
            - Add link data `$ios_url = 'https://example.com'` ([docs](/links/integrate/#redirections))
            - Add link data for a deep view `$ios_deepview = 'deepviewId'`  ([docs](/links/integrate/#deepview))
            - Enable a `Deep View` globally on the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/web/deepviews)
            - Add link data `$fallback_url = 'https://example.com'` ([docs](/links/integrate/#redirections))
            - Add `iOS/Android Custom URL` on the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)
            - Add `Default URL` (`$fallback_url`) on the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)

    - #### Open web instead of app
        - Your app is not installed
            - Device `navigates` to the [fallback](#custom-link-behavior) (e.g. an app store or website)
        - Your app is installed
            - *iOS:* need to override `Universal Links`
                - Add `$web_only = true` ([docs](/links/integrate/#redirections))
                - Add redirect `$ios_url = 'https://google.com'` ([docs](/links/integrate/#redirections))
                - *[or]* Append `/e/` to the deep link
                    - e.g. `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD` -> `https://example.app.link/e/fzmLEhobLD`
            - *Android:* need to override `App Links`
                - Uncheck `Enable App Links` and then hit `Save` the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)
                - Add redirect `$android_url = 'https://google.com'` ([docs](/links/integrate/#redirections))
                - Add a broken URI Scheme with `$android_deeplink_path = 'random'` ([docs](/links/integrate/#deep-linking))

- ### Social link behavior
    - Use [OG Tags](#open-graph) to display content as a preview card in Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, iMessage, etc.
        - Basics are `$og_title`, `$og_description`, and `$og_image_url`
    - Use [Deep Views]() to display content as a website
        - Increases [install attribution](https://branch.io/deepview/)
        - Completes deep linking experience in [certain apps](#default-link-behavior)

- ### UTM Behavior

!!! warning "Not Enabled by Default"
    To enable this functionality, please contact your Customer Success Manager or integrations@branch.io

  - When redirecting to a web URL, Branch automatically passes through any values from the following Branch link analytics tags as UTM parameters:

      - ~campaign -> utm_campaign
      - ~channel -> utm_source
      - ~feature -> utm_medium

  - This applies to web URLs defined using any of the following $fallback_url, $ios_url, $android_url, $desktop_url, $original_url, and $canonical_url.
  - If these UTM parameters are already detected on the URLs being redirected to, Branch will not overwrite them.
  - For more information about UTM parameters, please read Google Analytic's [Custom Campaigns](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863) article.

## Create deep links

- ### Short links
    - Short links are the most common deep link
    - You can customize the subdomain of `example.app.link`, or change to your own personal domain (`links.yoursite.com`)
    - You can tailor the appearance of the short code to a custom `alias` during creation
        - Aliases can be short strings, e.g. `https://example.app.link/october-sale`
        - Or can be full link path, e.g. `https://example.app.link/product/id1234`
    - Short links encapsulate [link data](#configure-deep-links) inside them on link creation
        - e.g. existing link `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`
    - Short links can have additional data appended to them
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD?content_id=123`
    - Methods of creating short links
        - Use [Quick Links](/dashboard/analytics/#quick-links) for fast link creation and easy tracking
        - Use our [App SDK](#dialog-code?ios=create-deep-link&android=create-deep-link&adobe=create-deep-link&cordova=create-deep-link&mparticleAndroid=create-deep-link&mparticleIos=create-deep-link&titanium=create-deep-link&reactNative=create-deep-link&unity=create-deep-link&xamarin=create-deep-link) to create and share links within your app
        - Use our [Web SDK](/web/integrate/#create-deep-link) to create links which help convert your web users to app users
        - Use our [HTTP API](/apps/api/#link-create) to programmatically create links from your server
        - Use our [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/branch-link-creator/pekdpppibljpmpbcjelehhnldnfbglgf) to generate links from your browser

- ### Long links
    - Long links can be created without a network call to Branch
    - Long links need [link data](#configure-deep-links) to be added as a query string. Be sure to URI encode any urls in the link.
        - e.g. existing link `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD?foo=bar&baz=456&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbranch.io%2F`
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://example.app.link/?foo=bar&baz=456&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbranch.io%2F`
    - Long links need a `/a/` and a [Branch Key](/dashboard/integrate/#understand-the-branch-key) if you use a `custom link domain`
        - e.g. existing link `https://link.example.com/5NPh/p4M09KRLrD?foo=bar&baz=456&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbranch.io%2F`
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://link.example.com/a/key_live_kaFuWw8WvY7yn1d9yYiP8gokwqjV0Swt?foo=bar&baz=456&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbranch.io%2F`
    - Long links need a `/a/` and a [Branch Key](/dashboard/integrate/#understand-the-branch-key) if you use a `bnc.lt`
        - e.g. existing link `https://bnc.lt/5NPh/p4M09KRLrD?foo=bar&baz=456&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbranch.io%2F`
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://bnc.lt/a/key_live_kaFuWw8WvY7yn1d9yYiP8gokwqjV0Swt?foo=bar&baz=456&$fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbranch.io%2F`
    - When adding `tags` to a dynamic link, enter each tag separately
        - e.g. https://example.app.link/?foo=bar&tags=tag1&tags=tag2

## Configure deep links

You're free to add any of your own key-value parameters to a Branch link. These parameters will be passed to your app via the Branch SDK, however some keys will have specific extra effects.

- ### Analytical labels

    - These labels allow you to filter and organize your deep links

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | ~channel | | Use channel to tag the route that your link reaches users. For example, tag links with `'Facebook'` or `'LinkedIn'` to help track clicks and installs through those paths separately
        | ~feature | | This is the feature of your app that the link might be associated with. For example, if you had built a referral program, you would label links with the feature 'referral'
        | ~campaign | | Use this field to organize the links by actual campaign. For example, if you launched a new feature or product and want to run a campaign around that
        | ~stage | | Use this to categorize the progress or category of a user when the link was generated. For example, if you had an invite system accessible on level 1, level 3 and 5, you could differentiate links generated at each level with this parameter
        | ~tags | | This is a free form entry with unlimited values `['string']`. Use it to organize your link data with labels that don't fit within the bounds of the above
        | type | `0` | Must be an `int`. Set to `1` to limit deep link to a single use. Set to `2` to make the link show up under [Quick Links](https://dashboard.branch.io/marketing) while adding `$marketing_title` to `data`. Does not work with the Native SDKs.

    - These labels allow you to customize attribution windows for a single link

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | $click_install_window_days | 7 | Time between a click or a web to app auto redirect and an install or reinstall. (i.e., https://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$click_install_window_days=3)

        | $impression_conversion_window_days | 7 | Time between an ad impression and a conversion event. Conversion events include commerce events (e.g. purchase, add to cart), all custom events, and all view events like pageviews & content views. (i.e., https://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$impression_session_start_window_days=7)

- ### Custom data

    - Pass any custom data to be read inside your app

        | Key | Value | Usage

        | nav_here | `content/123` | Any key-value pair

- ### Redirections

    - Navigate to different locations based on device information
    - Navigation URLs must be websites, not deep links

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | $fallback_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for all platforms - so you don't have to enable it by platform. Note that Branch will forward all robots to this URL, which **overrides any OG tags** entered in the link.  System-wide Default URL (set in Link Settings)
        | $fallback_url_xx | | Change the redirect endpoint for all platforms based on a [lower-case Alpha-2 country code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search). For example, `$fallback_url_de="..."` would redirect Germany deep link clicks. You should also set `$fallback_url` to act as the global redirect in addition to the country-specific ones.
        | $desktop_url | | Change the redirect endpoint on desktops Text-Me-The-App page (set in Link Settings)
        | $ios_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for iOS  App Store page for your app (set in Link Settings)

        | $web_only | `false` | Force to open the `$fallback_url` instead of the app

- ### Forced redirections

    - Prevent error messages from other apps when Branch deep links are clicked

        | Key | Value | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | $uri_redirect_mode | **0** | This is the default value that yields the standard behavior where we don't try to open the app if the user can see an error.
        | $uri_redirect_mode | **1** | Smart redirect mode. Same behavior as 0 until we know the user has the app installed through Branch persona data. In that case, force URI schemes to open the app.
        | $uri_redirect_mode | **2** | Forceful redirect mode. Always try to force open the app, even if it risks showing an [error message](/_assets/img/pages/links/uri-error-message.png) when the app is not installed.

        | $deeplink_path | `open?link_click_id=1234` | Set the deep link path for all platforms - so you don't have to enable it by platform. When the Branch SDK receives a link with this parameter set, it will automatically load the custom URI path contained within
        | $android_deeplink_path | | Set the deep link path for Android apps. When the Branch SDK receives a link with this parameter set, it will automatically load the custom Android URI path contained within
        | $ios_deeplink_path | | Set the deep link path for iOS apps. When the Branch SDK receives a link with this parameter set, it will automatically load the custom iOS URI path contained within
        | $desktop_deeplink_path | | Set the deep link path for Desktop apps. You will have to fetch this parameter and route the user accordingly
        | $match_duration | `7200` | Lets you control the snapshotting match timeout (the time that a click will wait for an app open to match) also known as attribution window. Specified in seconds
        | $always_deeplink | `true` | Set to `false` to make links always fall back to your mobile site. Does not apply to Universal Links or Android App Links.
        | $ios_redirect_timeout | `750` | Control the timeout that the client-side JS waits after trying to open up the app before redirecting to the App Store. Specified in milliseconds
        | $android_redirect_timeout | `750` | Control the timeout that the client side JS waits after trying to open up the app before redirecting to the Play Store. Specified in milliseconds
        | $custom_sms_text | | Text for SMS link sent for desktop clicks to this link. Must contain `{{ link }}` Value of Text me the app page in Settings

        | $deeplink_no_attribution | | Set to `true` for the links to only support deep linking without any attribution for that link.


- ### Content

    - Handle content properties

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | $publicly_indexable | `1` | Cannot modify here. Needs to be set by the Branch Universal Object
        | ~keyword | | Keywords for which this content should be discovered by. Just assign an array of strings with the keywords you'd like to use
        | $canonical_identifier | | This is the unique identifier for content that will help Branch dedupe across many instances of the same thing. Suitable options: a website with pathing, or a database with identifiers for entities
        | $exp_date | `0` | The date when the content will not longer be available or valid. The value must be an epoch timestamp in milliseconds (e.g. `1529612995526`) within the Branch Universal Object. The click will be attributed, but the install/open will not be. This will not return deep link data once expired.
        | $link_exp_date | `0` | The date when the content will not longer be available or valid. The value must be an epoch timestamp in milliseconds (e.g. `1529612995526`). Unlike the above, the link is deleted. If it is clicked on after deletion, redirection will continue to work, but with no data passing.
        | $content_type | | This is a label for the type of content present. Apple recommends that you use uniform type identifier as described here
        | $do_not_process | `false` | This will prevent click tracking and storage of link analytics. Deep link data will still flow into the app from link click to app open.

        | $twitter_app_country | | Set the app country for the app card
        | $twitter_player | | Set the video player's URL. Defaults to the value of `$og_video`.
        | $twitter_player_width | | Set the player's width in pixels
        | $twitter_player_height | | Set the player's height in pixels

- ### Other Reserved Keys

    | Key | Default | Usage
    | --- | --- | ---
    | data | | Used by Branch to contain top-level link information. If this parameter is added to a Branch link via appending query params, it will be dropped. It can be safely used when creating a link manually via the dashboard.

- ### Custom Tags

    - Handle custom meta tags

        | Key | Value
        | --- | ---
        | $custom_meta_tags | Valid stringified JSON dictionary of the tags’ keys and values

    - Valid dictionary example: "{\"twitter:player:stream\": \"https://branch.io\"}". This will result in the following meta tag: `<meta property="twitter:player:stream" content="https://branch.io" />`
    - If you create the link via the Dashboard, don’t worry about stringifying the dictionary. It will be done automatically.
    - apple_touch_icon is a special key in the dictionary. If you set it, we will add a `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="<url>" />` tag to the scraped HTML page. This will allow you to show a custom icon for previews in iMessage, Safari Bookmarks, Slack, etc.

- ### Universal Object

    - Properties for the Branch Universal Object within your [app](#dialog-code?ios=create-content-reference&android=create-content-reference&adobe=create-deep-link&cordova=create-content-reference&mparticleAndroid=create-content-reference&mparticleIos=create-content-reference&titanium=create-content-reference&reactNative=create-content-reference&unity=create-content-reference&xamarin=create-content-reference) integration

        | Key | Default | Usage | Link Property
        | --- | :-: | --- | :-:
        | canonicalIdentifier | | **(Required)** This is the unique identifier for content that will help Branch dedupe across many instances of the same thing. Suitable options: a website with pathing, or a database with identifiers for entities | `$canonical_identifier`
        | canonicalUrl | | The canonical URL, used for SEO purposes | `$canonical_url`
        | title | | The name for the piece of content | `$og_title`
        | contentDescription | | A description for the content | `$og_description`
        | contentImageUrl | | The image URL for the content. Must be an absolute path | `$og_image_url `
        | price | | The price of the item | `$amount`
        | currency | | The currency representing the price in ISO 4217 currency code | `$currency`
        | contentIndexingMode | `"public"` | Can be set to either `"public"` or `"private"`. Public indicates that you'd like this content to be discovered by other apps. | `$publicly_indexable`
        | contentMetadata | | Any custom key-value data e.g. `{ "custom": "data" }`

    - Best practices for the Branch Universal Object
        - Do
            - Set the `canonicalIdentifier` to a unique, de-duped value across instances of the app
            - Ensure that the `title`, `contentDescription` and `imageUrl` properly represent the object
            - Initialize the Branch Universal Object and call logEvent with the `VIEW_ITEM` event on page load
            - Call showShareSheet and createShortLink later in the life cycle, when the user takes an action that needs a link
            - Call the additional object events (purchase, share completed, etc) when the corresponding user action is taken
        - Do not
            - Set the same `title`, `contentDescription` and `imageUrl` across all objects
            - Wait to initialize the object and register views until the user goes to share
            - Wait to initialize the object until you conveniently need a link
            - Create many objects at once and register views in a `for` loop.


## Read deep links

## Troubleshoot issues

- ### Deep links do not open app
    - Make sure you are clicking on a deep link (e.g. `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`)
    - Make sure you are not pasting a deep link in the address bar (in most cases, deep links must be clicked on)
    - Make sure the deep link is not wrapped (e.g. `http://bit.ly/2yz3b8D` instead of `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`)
    - Make sure you have [configure your dashboard](/dashboard/integrate/) and [configure your app](#dialog-code)
    - Make sure the `Branch key` [in your app](#dialog-code) matches the `Branch key` [in your deep link](#view-deep-link-data)
    - Make sure you have not [disabled universal linking on iOS](/apps/ios/#re-enable-universal-linking)
    - Make sure you understand the [expected behavior of deep links](#default-link-behavior)
    - Make sure the deep link domain matches your [link domain](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings) (e.g. link domain = `example.app.link`, deep link = `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`)

- ### View deep link data
    - Add `?debug=1` to the end of your deep link
    - For example: https://example.app.link/aQXXDHaxKF?debug=1

- ### View deep link stats
    - Add `?stats=1` to the end of your deep link
    - For example: https://example.app.link/aQXXDHaxKF?stats=1

- ### Branch links in Snapchat Stories iOS

    - Snap won't let you attach redirecting links to stories. The following work around disables the redirects until you get the link attached, and then re-enables them after you create your story.

        1. Create your Quick Link to be attached to your Snap story
        1. On the Configure Options section, do the following:
            - Add the key `$always_deeplink`, and the value of `false` in the Deep Linking tab
            - Enable a deepview on the iOS platform in the Redirects tab

        1. Attach this link to your Snap story
        1. Come back and edit the Quick Link to:
            - Delete the `$always_deeplink` key/value from the Deep Linking tab
            - Remove the deepview on iOS in the Redirects tab

- ### Deep links in China
    - We have found that our links don’t work with some Chinese ISPs. Here’s a list of the ones we have tested:

        | ISP Name | Behavior
        | --- | ---
        | China Mobile | Works as expected
        | China Net | Works as expected
        | Great Wall | Timeout error, `ERR_TIMED_OUT` on link response
