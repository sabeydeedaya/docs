The basic integration involves four parts:

1. [Configure your ESP](#configure-your-esp)
1. [Activate integration and setup link behavior](#activate-integration)
1. [Configure your mobile app](#configure-your-mobile-app)
1. [Updating the links in your email](#using-universal-email)

Universal Email allows you to automatically convert your email links into multi-platform deep links that take users directly to content in the app on mobile devices, while still maintaining the same web experience for desktop and mobile users without the app.

When a link is clicked by a user without the app, it will route that user to the original web URL (including on desktop). When a link is clicked by a user with your app, it will direct that user into the relevant in-app content regardless of platform or email client.
